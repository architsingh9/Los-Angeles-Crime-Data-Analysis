# Los-Angeles-Crime-Data-Analysis

# Project Title:
Comprehensive Analysis of Los Angeles Crime Trends Utilizing Data Science Techniques

# Abstract:
This research project undertakes an extensive examination of Los Angeles crime data from 2020 onwards, with a focus on meticulous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The study aims to uncover crime trends, seasonal patterns, regional disparities, and correlations with economic indicators, enhancing understanding of public safety dynamics and contributing valuable insights into crime prevention and policy formulation.

# Objectives:

To conduct an in-depth cleaning and preparation of the Los Angeles crime dataset for analysis.
To identify and visualize crime trends, seasonal fluctuations, and type-specific frequencies.
To examine the impact of socio-economic factors and major events on crime rates.
To contribute to the strategic planning and resource allocation for crime prevention and public safety improvement.
